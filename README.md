# Autism Prediction Model
## Introduction
This project uses machine learning models to predict autism based on a dataset from Kaggle. The models evaluated include Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project has been uploaded in the same repository. This dataset contained more data rows for negative outcome than the positive ones, therefore , SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) has been used for over-sampling. 

## Models and Evaluation
The models were trained and tested using scikit-learn's train-test split and evaluated with cross-validation. The models include:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**


## Results
The best accuracy score achieved was **93%** using **Random Forest Classifier**.
